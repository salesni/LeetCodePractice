# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:

#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        current = head
        while current and current.next:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next

        return head
